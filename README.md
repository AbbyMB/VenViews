# VenViews
VenViews is a site used to view and post music venue reviews, authored by Abby Bardin, Abigail Symes, John Trocchi and Scott Sheldon.
Features include viewing all venues listed on the site, as well as viewing venue details for each venue on its own page. Authenticated users with user names and passwords can submit reviews of specific venues which are then displayed on each venue's page. Other users can then "upvote" specific reviews that they find particularly helpful, and/or "downvote" those reviews that they do not find relevant.
VenViews is built using Ruby on Rails and uses React to display venue show pages that the user can interact with.
